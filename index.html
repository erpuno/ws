    <h3>F# WebSocket Server</h3>
    <h4>Annotation</h4>
    <p>The idea to write web servers and web frameworks
       in all languages came to my mind ever since I
       realized that what I did for the Erlang ecosystem:
       the direction of frameworks for enterprises under
       the general brand N2O, and now as part of the <a href="https://erp.uno">erp.uno</a>
       platform; quite applicable for other languages and
       platforms as well. This article provides a version
       of the websocket server for the F # programming language,
       <a href="https://ws.erp.uno">ws.erp.uno</a>.
       Package address: <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/ws">nuget.org/packages/ws</a>.
       Repository address: <a href="https://github.com/erpuno/ws">erpuno/ws</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Foreword</h4>

    <p>
    <b>Haskell</b>. The first experiment was carried out by Andrey Melnikov
    as a port for Haskell: <a href="https://github.com/nponeccop/n2o.hs">N2O.HS</a>,
    later a more complete version with N2O and NITRO expressed in existential signatures
    was made by Marat Khafizov, who runs the <a href="https://github.com/o3">O3</a> Github
    organization and the <a herf="https://o3.click">o3.click</a> website.
    It is completely incomprehensible to me why not a single Haskell programmer,
    who seems to be supposed to admire minimalism, does not follow this path,
    but usually looks for the truth in such frameworks as UrWeb, IHP, UnisonWeb.
    In my opinion, these are all overcomplicated things.</p>

    <p><b>Standard ML</b>. Also for academic purposes, Marat Khafizov made a port
      of the bundle of the N2O web server and the NITRO web framework into the
      Standard ML language (both major versions of SML/NJ and MLton) &mdash;
      this work is presented by the <a href="https://github.com/o1">O1</a> organization on Github.
      This is the language that I consider appropriate to teach as the first
      academic programming language (prior to acquaintance with the industrial
      languages Erlang, F#, Haskell).</p>

    <p><b>Lean</b>. To consolidate my idea and articulate it more clearly and accurately,
       I asked <a href="https://github.com/forked-from-1kasper">Siegmentation Fault</a>
       to make a port to an even more formal programming language, the Lean 4 mathematical prover.
       This version of the N2O web server and the NITRO web framework
       is presented by Github by the <a href="https://github.com/o89">O98</a>
       organization and two sites at once: <a href="https://lean4.dev">lean4.dev</a>
       and <a href="https://bum.pm">bum.pm</a>. The latter is a package manager
       written in Lean 4, which Aleksandr Temerev from CERN helps us to maintain.
       Lean 4 N2O projects were liked by Leonardo de Moura, author of Lean and Z3,
       and we are immensely happy about it.</p>

    <h4>Idiomatic WebSocket server in F#</h4>

    <p>Idiomatic criteria can be perceived differently by everyone,
       but basically this means a minimum of preludes and a maximum of essence,
       one way or another, the main mantra of all minimalists in general and N2O
       infrastructure in particular. So, in the modern criteria for the idiomaticity
       of a web server for the F # language, I would highlight the following:
       1) the use of the System.Net.WebSockets system classes, which already
         provide a buffered encoder and decoder of frames of the RFC 6455 standard;
       2) the server must be built on Async computer expressins;
       3) MailboxProcessor should be used to manage asynchronous threads of execution,
          and not a self-written system of workers, which, although it will help
          squeeze the latter out of F # (I got 14 million messages per second),
          will not demonstrate the essence, since it will be a deviation towards runtimes;
       4) Using the TcpListener and TcpClient, NetworkStream classes. You are not allowed
          to use anything else!</p>

    <h4>What to read before writing?</h4>

    <p>After a bit of googling, I realized that the Internet lacks an article
       that describes the history of the concept of asynchronous computation
       and computational expressions, which are popularly known by the async/await
       keywords. I see the future article called "Survey of brief Async history",
       which will show a retrospective of Async technology:
    </p>

<p>0) J operator 1965; <br>
1) LISP call/cc 1968; <br>
2) Erlang 1986; <br>
3) Concurrent ML 1998; <br>
4) Haskell async 2004; <br>
5) C # async yield 2006; <br>
6) Perl IO: Async 2007; <br>
7) F # Async 2010 <br>
8) C # / PHP Async 2012 <br>
9) Python async 2015 <br>
10) ECMAScript async 2017</p>

<p>The seminal article on F# async is Leo Gorodinsky's `<b>F# Async Guide</b>`, jet.com.
   The main book that I would recommend to look through before getting acquainted
   with F# is `<b>Expert F # 4.0</b>` by the author of the language Don Syme.
   The main presentation on F# Async, I would call Don Syme's talk at the London
   meetup &mdash; `<b>Some F# for the Erlang programmer</b>`. Armed with these documents
   and this Gist snippet, I went to Lviv to write the most idiomatic websocket server.</p>

    <h4>Showcase</h4>

    <p>As is usually accepted in backtracking systems, Prolog and declarative languages,
    we will move from the end, namely from the interface that we want to get.
    I would like the ECHO Server to be an id function.</p>

        <figure>
        <code>
  open N2O

  module Program =

    [&lt;EntryPoint>]
    let main _ =
        let mutable ret = 0

        try Stream.protocol &lt;- fun x -> x
            use ws = Server.start "0.0.0.0" 1900
            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep -1
        with exn ->
            printfn "EXIT: %s" exn.Message
            ret &lt;- 1
        ret
        </code>
        </figure>

<h4>Asynchronous process architecture</h4>

    <p>For those familiar with the Erlang/OTP architecture,
       it is known that designing network applications begins
       with a tree supervisor of lightweight processes and the
       protocols that govern their interactions. Child
       processes usually share CancellationToken lifetime tokens,
       so that exceptions thrown in parent processes can cancel
       the entire subprocess tree. Therefore, the process loops
       contain the expression</p>

        <figure>
        <code>
    while not ct.IsCancellationRequested do
        </code>
        </figure>

<p>Our websocket server consists of 7 asynchronous processes:</p>

        <figure>
        <code>
         [Sup]    [L]*
        /        /
 [start]--[S]--[C]*
        \        \
         [H]      [T]*
        </code>
        </figure>

<p>The legend of this tree is as follows: [start] node is the entry point from
   which the rest of the asynchronous processes will be born, corresponds to
   the <b>start</b> function; The [S] node cooperates with the asynchronous process
   represented by the listen function; [Sup] node corresponds to the
   <b>startSupervisor</b> function; [C] the node corresponds to the <b>startClient</b>
   function; [H] node meets the <b>heartbeat</b> function requirement;
   [L] node matches the <b>loop</b> function; The [T] node meets the <b>telemetry</b>
   function requirement. An asterisk will denote processes, the number of
   which depends on the number of active connections: [C]*, [L]*, [T]*.</p>

<h4>Interaction protocols</h4>

    <p>At the moment of birth of the client [C], in the parent process of
       the server [S], the notification [S] -> [Sup] takes place according
       to the so-called Supervisor Sup protocol with the same type.
       The public protocol of the public function Stream.protocol is
       represented by the Msg type , which is used to control an asynchronous process [L].</p>

    <p>The server ping system is implemented compatible with the Sup
       and Msg protocols , the heartbit process [H] sends a Tick message
       at intervals to the supervisor [Sup], which in turn sends broadcasts
       to all telemetry clients [T] created on the same queue as [C],
       ie the same protocol.</p>

    <p>Processes [T], [L] and [C] share the WebSocket stream and are all
       connected to the server's supervisor, notifying it in case of exceptions.</p>

        <figure>
        <code>
    type Msg =
        | Bin of byte array
        | Text of string
        | Nope

    type Sup =
        | Connect of MailboxProcessor&lt;Msg> * WebSocket
        | Disconnect of MailboxProcessor&lt;Msg>
        | Close of WebSocket
        | Tick
        </code>
        </figure>


<h4>RFC 6455 Handshake</h4>

    <p>Functions for handling HTTP headers. <b>isWebSocketsUpgrade</b> looks
       for an Upgrade and WebSocket pair in the headers. <b>getLines</b> returns
       headers as an array of strings, and the <b>getKey</b> function returns the
       header value by its key.</p>

        <figure>
        <code>
    let isWebSocketsUpgrade (lines: string array) =
        Array.exists (fun (x:string) ->
            "upgrade: websocket" = x.ToLower()) lines

    let getKey (key: string) arr =
        try let f (s: String) = s.StartsWith(key)
            (Array.find f arr).[key.Length + 1..]
        with _ -> ""

    let getLines (bytes: byte array) len =
        if len > 8 then
            bytes.[..(len - 9)]
            |> UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetString
            |> fun hs -> hs.Split([| "\r\n" |],
                   StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries)
        else
            [||]
        </code>
        </figure>

        <p>The RFC 6455 response feature is called handshake.
           As far as I know, this functionality is not in the system namespaces..</p>

        <figure>
        <code>
    let acceptString6455 acceptCode =
        "HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols\r\n" +
        "Upgrade: websocket\r\n" +
        "Connection: Upgrade\r\n" +
        "Sec-WebSocket-Accept: " + acceptCode + "\r\n\r\n"

    let handshake lines =
        (getKey "Sec-WebSocket-Key:" lines)
           + "258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11"
        |> Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes
        |> SHA1CryptoServiceProvider.Create().ComputeHash
        |> Convert.ToBase64String
        |> acceptString6455
        |> Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes
        </code>
        </figure>

<h4>Asynchronous Server Processes</h4>

    <p>The first process, [start], is an entry point where three processes
       start at once: the supervisor of all connections [Sup] process,
       the connection listener server process [S], and, if the Server.ticker
       flag is enabled, the heartbeat process, which works as an interval
       cyclic timer [H]. The epilogue of the [start] process contains the
       tokenization of the global token for all subprocesses when the
       variable is released, which contains the websocket server in external code.</p>

        <figure>
        <code>
    let start (addr: string) (port: int) =
        let cts = new CancellationTokenSource()
        let token = cts.Token
        let sup = startSupervisor token
        let listener = TcpListener(IPAddress.Parse(addr), port)

        try
            listener.Start(10)
        with
            | :? SocketException ->
                failwithf "%s:%i is using by another program" addr port
            | err ->
                failwithf "%s" err.Message

        Async.StartImmediate(listen listener token sup, token)
        if ticker then Async.StartImmediate(heartbeat interval token sup, token)

        { new IDisposable with
            member x.Dispose() = cts.Cancel() }
        </code>
        </figure>

    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>

<h4>What's next?</h4>

    <p>Then there are three phases:<br><br>

1) Peer context: port, IP address, headers, endpoint, service information; <br>
2) BERT serialization for compatibility with N2O client infrastructure; <br>
3) Implementation of the NITRO protocol.</p>
